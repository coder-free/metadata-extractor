  * Reliability
    * Converted all access to `byte[]` in `ExifReader` to be via `BufferReader`, ensuring proper bounds checking during processing
    * `JpegMetadataReader` no longer assumes that certain segments always hold one type of metadata, cycling through the segments available and opportunistically detecting segments that can be processed
    * Now stopping IFD processing when an invalid format type is encountered, helping to avoid populating directories with lots of rubbish from corrupt files
    * Can now decode version numbers of form `[0 1 0 0]` as well as `[48 49 48 48]`
    * Introduced new checked `BufferBoundsException` which is thrown by all `BufferReader` methods, ensuring that calling code properly handles cases when we run out of data

    * Significantly improved IPTC unit testing.
    * Added unit tests for Sony Type 1 and Type 6 makernotes
    * Updated all unit tests to jUnit 4
    * `AllTests` class no longer needed and removed
    * Effort to make unit tests work in non-English locales

    * Fixed a potential exception in `Directory.getString(int)` when the underlying value is an array of primitives other than int
    * Fixed typo in `GpsDirectory` which incorrectly confused the `TAG_GPS_IMG_DIRECTION_REF` and `TAG_GPS_IMG_DIRECTION` tag names
    * Corrected integer value assigned to tag `TAG_GPS_AREA_INFORMATION`

    * Introduced Yuri's fix for the various `SOF0-SOFF` Jpeg segments
    * Improved Exif directory 'user comment' decoding for various character sets.
    * Avoid `OutOfMemoryError` if the advertised size of the image thumbnail is larger than the available bytes in the Exif segment

  * Public API changes
    * Metadata and Directory are now both iterable, so they support `foreach` now
    * Removed checked `MetadataException` from all description getters
    * Refactored all `Reader` classes to take their data in the extract method, rather than in their constructors, offering thread safety and allowing reuse
    * Created method `Metadata.hasErrors()` that reports whether there exists an error in any directory
    * Separated Exif IFD1 (thumbnail) tags out from the IFD0 tags and into the new `ExifThumbnailDirectory` with `ExifThumbnailDescriptor`
    * Split `ExifDescriptor` into `ExifIFD0Descriptor` and `ExifSubIFDDescriptor` to mirror actual IFD structure in physical metadata, preventing against tag overwrites due to merging, and making later support for writing metadata easier
    * Added an overload of `Directory.getString` that accepts a charset
    * Use of generics
      * Replaced several instances of `ArrayList` and `HashMap` with their generic counterparts
      * Genericised methods on Metadata for obtaining Directory objects, removing several casts
      * Made `TagDescriptor` generic
      * Added generic constraint upon `Metadata.getDirectory` and `Metadata.containsDirectory` methods and removed cast and check that are subsequently unnecessary
      * Made descriptor constructors take more specific directory types
    * Added overload of `Directory.getDate` that accepts a `TimeZone` to be used if the underlying value is a string and must be parsed
    * Renamed `ExifDirectory.TAG_COMPRESSION` to `ExifDirectory.TAG_THUMBNAIL_COMPRESSION`
    * Removed some incomplete and unused constants on `ExifDirectory`
    * Removed dependency upon `com.sun.image.codec.jpeg` in `JpegMetadataReader`
    * Created hashCode method for `Rational` as it overrides equals
    * Removed old deprecated constructors for reader classes

  * Internal API changes
    * `Rational` now backed by long, not int
    * Considerable simplification of interface `MetadataReader` and all its implementations
    * Overhauled means of reading different types from `byte[]}} across all {{{Reader` classes via use of new `BufferReader` class
    * Created methods to add arrays of float/double to a `Directory`
    * Renamed `Metadata.getDirectory` as `getOrCreateDirectory`, and made a new method `getDirectory` that doesn't lazily create a directory
    * Metadata readers only accept non-null `byte[]` as a data source
    * Added overload of `BufferReader.getString` that takes a charset
    * Simplified `ExifReader` by removing some fields so that state is now mostly maintained on the stack
    * `JpegSegmentReader.readSegment()` no longer throws `JpegProcessingException`, simplifying some call sites too

## 2.3.0 ##

_Released 12 Jan 2006_

  * New tags from Exif 2.2 specification (A401-A420).
  * Fixed stack overflow exception in `ExifReader` for cyclic directory references.  Thanks to John Sidney-Woollett for reporting this bug (reported for Fuji FinePix A101 and Canon 20D).
  * Fixed rounding error in the shutter speed description which was giving the wrong value most of the time (for example, 1/32 instead of 1/50). Thanks for Gli Blr and Mark Edwards for pointing out this error.
  * Fix thread safety bug in `ExifReader`.
  * Fixed `OutOfMemoryError` seen in certain Canon 20D images. Thanks to Henry Yeung for providing an image to reproduce this error.

## 2.2.2 ##

_Released 22 Nov 2003_

  * Fixed a bug where version strings were assumed to be comprised of exactly four parts, and cases were found where a different number existed

## 2.2.1 ##

## 2.2.0 ##

_Released 18 Oct 2003_

  * Added support for extraction of Jpeg image information (from the SOF0 segment.) Thanks to Darrell Silver for commencing the code for this extension
  * Added support for reading Jpeg comments
  * Additional Nikon camera makernote support for D1/D100 family models. Thanks to Daniel Waeber for providing sample images and to Fabrizio Giudici for publishing his work in decoding this makernote data.

  * Fixed bug for multi-component tag values of certain types. Thanks to Derek Wegner for identifying the bug and providing a solution.
  * More unit tests (consequently, the source-code download is much larger.)
  * First version with an Ant build script

## 2.1.0 ##

_Released 12 Jan 2003_

  * Extract methods no longer throw exceptions, with error information stored in `Metadata` instances, using `hasErrors()` and `getErrors()`
  * `Metadata` and dependant classes now serializable for network transmission, and persistance in files & databases
  * Support for extracting metadata from `InputStream`s, such as network connections
  * Replaced code that depended upon JDK 1.4

## 2.0 ##

_Released 10 Dec 2002_

Enormous changes to the class and package structure in this release prohibit a class-by-class breakdown of changes.  The focus is no longer on Exif metadata alone, but now on general metadata extraction from multiple media types.

Changes support:

  * easier future extensibility
  * IPTC metadata extraction
  * multiple directories of tags
  * descriptor class for interpreting values in a given directory
  * multiple media and metadata types
  * enhanced handling of exif makernote values
  * many more unit tests
  * numerous other enhancements
  * minor bug fixes

Simpler extensibility changes the focus from exif extraction alone and opens the scope to general metadata extraction.  Future development will introduce new media and metadata support with little or no impact to existing classes.

## 1.2 ##

_Released 6 Nov 2002_

ExifExtractor.java
  * Proper traversing of Exif file structure and complete refactor & tidy of the codebase (a few unnoticed bugs removed)
  * Reads makernote data for 6 families of camera (5 makes)
  * Tags now stored in directories... use the `IFD_*` constants to refer to the image file directory you require (Exif, Interop, GPS and `Makernote*`) -- this avoids collisions where two tags share the same code
  * Correct extraction of multi-component values
  * No longer decodes image to extract Exif data -- this is much faster
  * Takes componentCount of unknown tags into account
  * Now understands GPS tags (thanks to Colin Briton for his help with this)
  * Returns null when no Exif data present, instead of throwing an exception
  * Some other bug fixes, pointed out by users around the world. Thanks!

ExifLoader.java
  * Removed (unnecessary)

ImageInfo.java
  * Stored IFD directories in separate tag-spaces
  * `iterator()` now returns an Iterator over a list of `TagValue` objects
  * More `get*Description()` methods to detail GPS tags, among others

TagValue.java
  * New class to encapsualte information about a particular tag

Rational.java
  * Improved `toSimpleString()` to factor more complex rational numbers into a simpler form.  I.e. 10/15 -> 2/3
  * `toSimpleString()` now accepts a boolean flag, '`allowDecimals`' which will display the rational number in decimal form if it fits within 5 digits.  I.e. 3/4 -> 0.75 when allowDecimal == true

JpegSegmentReader.java
  * New class to extract APP1 segment (and others) from a Jpeg file -- this avoids decoding images just to get metadata

`tests\*.java`
  * First collection of basic unit tests, to compile against JUnit
  * Doesn't yet cover all classes

Website
  * A collection of JPEGs from various digital camera models, collected on the web and contributed by many users of ExifExtractor
  * Updated documentation

## 1.1.1 ##

Rational.java
  * Added `toSimpleString()` method, which returns a simplified and hopefully more readable version of the Rational.  I.e. 2/10 -> 1/5, 10/2 -> 5

ExifExtractor.java

  * Removed unnecessary casting operations
  * Added a few more comments
  * Removed redundant and commented code (I'm using a CVS system now)

ExifLoader.java
  * Added a much-needed `close()` call to a created input stream, allowing continued use of the File object passed to `ExifLoader.getImageInfo(File)`

ImageInfo.java
  * Make use of new `Rational` method `toSimpleString()` for more elegant output
  * Use of `DecimalFormatter` to tidy output in selected `get***Description()` methods

## 1.1.0 ##

_Released 28 Aug 2002_

  * Descriptive tag values, including units and text for enumerations
  * Decoupling from JDK 1.4-specific libraries (tested with JDK 1.3)
