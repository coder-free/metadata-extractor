# Building an Image Database #

The metadata-extractor project maintains a database of sample images from many different models of camera, scanner, smartphone and software product.

This collection has been largely built by the contributions of many kind people from all over the world and internet.

You can [view the full collection here](http://code.google.com/p/metadata-extractor/source/browse?repo=sample-images) and use it in any way you see fit.

## Uses ##

Having a large variety of input files aids in the development of this project.

  * As a system that consumes long streams of binary data, there are many possibilities for unexpected input. Variety is good.
  * Performance tests can more easily be run across large numbers of differing images.
  * It offers a convenient form of regression testing, as output metadata is versioned within the `sample-images` repository.

## Contribute ##

Despite being a very large collection, camera manufacturers have been busy. It's highly likely that you have a camera model that is not present in the list.

If you have an image, you can [email it to the author](https://code.google.com/u/drewnoakes/). If the file is too large for email, you might like to use a file transfer service such as [wetransfer](https://www.wetransfer.com/).

This is a public resource! If you are kind enough to contribute to it, you must also be careful enough to ensure that you have permission to grant use of the image to the project. Be aware that your camera may also support GPS, in which case your location will be included in the image.

The content of the image is not important. You may take a photo of a white wall if you wish, though interesting photos are more, well, interesting.

Please ensure that the image comes directly from the camera and is not modified by any software.

JPEG and camera raw files are welcome.

You will be credited for your contribution in the commit log, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Please be sure to explicitly state that you grant permission to this project to use the image as described on this wiki page.
